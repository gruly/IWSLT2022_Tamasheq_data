# IWSLT2022 - Low-resource Speech Translation Track: Tamashek-French Parallel Corpus

Repository for sharing the data in the Tamashek language, one of the languages for the low-resource speech translation track at IWSLT 2022.

## Parallel data
This corpus is a collection of radio recordings from [Studio Kalangou](https://www.studiokalangou.org/) translated to French. It comprises 17 hours of clean speech in Tamashek, translated to the French language. We also make available a 19 hour version of this corpus, including 2 additional hours of data that was labeled by annotators as potentially noisy.

* Speaker identification and gender: (information to be included soon)

## Additional Audio data
In addition to the 17-19 hours of Tamashek audio data aligned to French translations, and in light of recent work in self-supervised models for speech processing, we also provide participants with unlabaled raw audio data in the Tamashek language, as well as in other 4 languages spoken in the Republic of the Niger: Accented French (220 hours), Fulfulde (215 hours), Hausa (188 hours), Tamashek (397 hours) and Zarma (138 hours). All this data comes from the radio broadcastings of [Studio Kalangou](https://www.studiokalangou.org/) and [Studio Tamani](https://www.studiotamani.org/).

The participants are not required to use any of this data. 

Due to its size, this data will be made available through a website (link to be included here soon).
